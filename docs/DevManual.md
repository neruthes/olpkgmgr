# OlPkgMgr - Developer Manual


## Introduction

A user of some small distro (e.g. TinyCore Linux) may use this tool to create an overlayfs chroot environment
where packages of some other distro may be installed.

This approach may be similar to Nix and Gentoo Prefix.
Useful scenarios may include cgroup-free containerization.
